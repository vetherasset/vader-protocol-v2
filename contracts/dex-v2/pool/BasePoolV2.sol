/*
 * @dev Implementation of {BasePoolV2} contract.
 *
 * The BasePoolV2 contract keeps track of all the Vader pools in the form of
 * pairs. Each pair tracked through {pairInfo} mapping and is mapped against the
 * foreign asset for which the pair is created.
 *
 * Has function to deposited liquidity to any of pair by specifying the mapped
 * foreign asset against the pair.
 *
 * The minted liquidity is associated with a position, that is tracked by a minted NFT.
 * The NFT has information about the pair for which it represents the liquidity.
 *
 * The contract allows redeeming of liquidity against a particular pool by burning the
 * associated position representing NFT.
 *
 * The contract allows swapping of native to foreign assets and vice versa within a pair and
 * allows foreign to foreign asset swap across two different pairs.
 *
 * Keeps track of the cumulative prices for both native and foreign assets for
 * pairs and updates them after minting and burning of liquidity, and swapping of assets.
